Standing Wave 3 README
June 7, 2010

ABOUT THIS PROJECT

Standing Wave 3 is an AS3 code library designed for high level control of
the Flash Player's SampleDataEvent API for streaming audio output.  It
is based on a subset of the audio engine used by the Noteflight Score
Editor (see http://www.noteflight.com). 

- SW1 was never released.
- SW2 was a pure AS3 project open sourced by Joe Berkovitz
- SW3 is SW2 extensively refactored by Max Lord

Standing Wave 3 is very much like SW2, except that all of its core sample
storage and manipulation routines have been rewritten with Adobe Alchemy
to make them oodles more efficient.

The goal of StandingWave is to encapsulate the following kinds of
objects, permitting them to be easily chained together and combined to
produce complex, dynamic audio output:

- audio sources (MP3 or WAV files, algorithmic sound generators...)
- audio filters (echo, envelope shaping, equalization...)
- timed sequences of audio sources, which may be hierarchically composed

There are no fundamental musical concepts embodied in StandingWave,
but it may be straightforwardly extended with such, for instance by
reading MIDI files or by writing utility classes to manage tones,
scales, instruments, and so forth.


FLASH and FLEX VERSION REQUIREMENTS

StandingWave requires Flash Player 10.  It cannot be built or used
with Flash Player 9 or earlier.

The library code is intended to be compiled with the Flex MXMLC
compiler, not with the Flash IDE.  However there are no Flex APIs
actually used in StandingWave.

To use SW3, add the source to your Flex project, and add awave.swc to your library path.

A working Adobe Alchemy install is necessary to recompile the C libraries, 
but most users will not find this necessary. All alchemy routines are encapsulated
within the ActionScript object "Sample".
